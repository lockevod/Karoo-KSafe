/**
 * Pure unit tests for [CrashStateMachine].
 *
 * All tests are **synchronous** — the state machine owns no coroutines, no delays, no I/O.
 * Time is driven from two sources:
 *   - [SensorSample.timestampMs] for the state-machine internal clock (impact window,
 *     silence elapsed). Tests pass timestamps explicitly via [sample].
 *   - A mutable wall-clock variable for the cold-start guard / speed-update timestamps.
 *     Most tests pre-advance the wall clock past `coldStartGuardMs` so the guard is
 *     inert; the cold-start tests explicitly leave it inside the window.
